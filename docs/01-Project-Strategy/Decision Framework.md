# Decision Framework - StockAI Simplified

## Framework Purpose

This decision framework keeps us focused on building a working TypeScript application within 4 weeks while demonstrating professional development skills. Every decision should move us toward a deployable portfolio project, not a perfect system.

**Core Principle:** Working software that showcases TypeScript skills > Perfect architecture

---

## Decision Criteria (Priority Order)

### 1. TypeScript Skill Demonstration (Primary Goal)
**Question:** Does this decision showcase advanced TypeScript capabilities?

**Prioritize decisions that demonstrate:**
- Interface design and type composition
- Generic components and functions
- Union types and discriminated unions
- Type guards and runtime validation
- API integration with proper typing

**Example Decision:**
```typescript
// Good: Shows advanced TypeScript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  success: boolean;
  sources: SourceAttribution[];
}

// Avoid: Basic JavaScript patterns
const data = await fetch('/api/stock').then(r => r.json());
```

### 2. User Value (Secondary Goal)
**Question:** Does this solve a real user problem simply?

**Prioritize features that:**
- Provide immediate value (stock price + explanation)
- Are intuitive to use
- Solve the core problem (understanding stock movements)
- Don't require extensive learning

**Example Decision:**
```typescript
// Good: Simple, valuable
"Apple dropped 3% due to earnings miss and broader tech concerns"

// Avoid: Complex but not immediately useful
"Apple's beta-adjusted correlation coefficient indicates..."
```

### 3. 4-Week Timeline (Constraint)
**Question:** Can this be implemented well within our timeline?

**Prioritize decisions that:**
- Use existing, stable APIs
- Build on proven patterns
- Can be implemented incrementally
- Have clear success criteria

**Example Decision:**
```typescript
// Good: Uses existing API
const stockData = await fetchYahooFinance(symbol);

// Avoid: Requires building from scratch
const stockData = await ourCustomMLModel(symbol);
```

### 4. Portfolio Impact (Showcase Goal)
**Question:** Does this make the project impressive to potential employers?

**Prioritize decisions that:**
- Show modern development practices
- Demonstrate problem-solving skills
- Include production considerations
- Are easy to explain and demonstrate

## Technology Decision Framework

### When to Choose TypeScript Over JavaScript
**Always choose TypeScript** - this is our primary differentiator

### When to Choose Next.js Over Other Frameworks
**Choose Next.js when:**
- Need both frontend and API routes
- Want simple deployment to Vercel
- TypeScript integration is excellent
- File-based routing reduces complexity

### When to Choose External APIs Over Custom Implementation
**Choose external APIs when:**
- Functionality exists and is reliable
- Implementation would take > 1 week
- Not core to TypeScript demonstration
- Allows focus on integration patterns

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good: Focus on TypeScript integration
const explanation = await openai.generateExplanation(prompt);

// Avoid: Custom ML model (out of scope)
const explanation = await ourCustomModel.predict(features);
```

### When to Add New Features
**Add features only when:**
- Core features (stock lookup, AI explanation, chat) are complete
- Feature demonstrates new TypeScript patterns
- Implementation is < 1 day
- Enhances portfolio demonstration value

## Implementation Decision Framework

### Code Quality Decisions

**Always prioritize:**
- Type safety over convenience
- Error handling over happy path
- Code clarity over cleverness
- Consistent patterns over one-off solutions

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good: Type-safe with error handling
export async function fetchStockData(symbol: string): Promise<StockData> {
  if (!isValidStockSymbol(symbol)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid stock symbol');
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/stocks/${symbol}`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`API error: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  
  return stockDataSchema.parse(await response.json());
}

// Avoid: Unsafe and fragile
const fetchStock = async (symbol) => {
  const data = await fetch(`/api/stocks/${symbol}`).then(r => r.json());
  return data;
};
```

### UI/UX Decisions

**Prioritize:**
- Simple, clean interfaces
- Clear loading states
- Helpful error messages
- Responsive design basics

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good: Clear states and types
interface StockCardProps {
  stock: StockData | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  onRefresh: () => void;
}

// Avoid: Complex interactions
interface StockCardProps {
  stock: any;
  modes: string[];
  customizations: object;
  callbacks: any;
}
```

### Performance Decisions

**Optimize for:**
- Perceived performance (loading states)
- API response caching
- TypeScript compilation speed
- Simple state management

**Don't optimize for:**
- Extreme performance (not the goal)
- Complex caching strategies
- Premature optimization

## Weekly Decision Framework

### Week 1: Foundation
**Primary Question:** Does this establish solid TypeScript foundations?

**Decisions should prioritize:**
- Project structure and type organization
- API integration patterns
- Basic component architecture
- Deployment pipeline

### Week 2: Core Features
**Primary Question:** Does this add user value while showing TypeScript skills?

**Decisions should prioritize:**
- AI integration with proper typing
- Source attribution system
- Error handling patterns
- API response validation

### Week 3: Polish
**Primary Question:** Does this enhance the user experience and code quality?

**Decisions should prioritize:**
- Chat interface implementation
- Context management
- UI improvements
- Advanced TypeScript patterns

### Week 4: Finalization
**Primary Question:** Does this make the project portfolio-ready?

**Decisions should prioritize:**
- Production deployment
- Documentation
- Code cleanup
- Demo preparation

## Common Decision Scenarios

### "Should we add this feature?"

**Evaluation checklist:**
1. ✅ Does it demonstrate TypeScript skills?
2. ✅ Can it be implemented in < 1 day?
3. ✅ Does it solve a user problem?
4. ✅ Is it easy to explain in portfolio?

**If any answer is no, skip the feature.**

### "Should we use this library?"

**Evaluation checklist:**
1. ✅ Is it well-maintained and popular?
2. ✅ Does it have TypeScript support?
3. ✅ Will it save significant development time?
4. ✅ Does it align with our tech stack?

**If any answer is no, consider alternatives.**

### "Should we optimize this code?"

**Evaluation checklist:**
1. ✅ Is it causing user-visible performance issues?
2. ✅ Will optimization improve TypeScript demonstration?
3. ✅ Can optimization be done in < 2 hours?
4. ✅ Are core features complete?

**If any answer is no, focus on core features instead.**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
```typescript
// Avoid: Complex abstraction for simple need
class StockDataManagerFactoryBuilder {
  // 100 lines of complex code
}

// Good: Simple, clear implementation
export async function fetchStockData(symbol: string): Promise<StockData> {
  // 10 lines of clear, typed code
}
```

### Under-Typing
```typescript
// Avoid: Lazy typing
const data: any = await fetch('/api/stock').then(r => r.json());

// Good: Proper typing
const response = await fetch('/api/stock');
const data: ApiResponse<StockData> = await response.json();
```

### Feature Creep
```typescript
// Avoid: Adding complexity
interface StockCardProps {
  stock: StockData;
  showAdvancedMetrics: boolean;
  customAnalysis: boolean;
  realTimeUpdates: boolean;
  chartMode: 'basic' | 'advanced' | 'professional';
  // ... 10 more props
}

// Good: Essential features only
interface StockCardProps {
  stock: StockData;
  loading: boolean;
  onExplainClick: () => void;
}
```

## Decision Documentation

### For Each Major Decision, Document:

1. **What we decided**
2. **Why we decided it** (which criteria applied)
3. **What we considered** (alternatives)
4. **How it demonstrates TypeScript skills**

### Example Decision Log:

**Decision:** Use Zod for runtime validation
**Why:** Demonstrates TypeScript integration, improves type safety, prevents runtime errors
**Alternatives:** Manual validation, Joi, Yup
**TypeScript Value:** Shows understanding of design-time vs runtime type safety
