## Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript

##### Why we picked it
- **Familiarity level**: Developer-friendly with excellent TypeScript integration
- **Community + docs**: Extensive documentation, large community support, regular updates
- **Performance / scalability**: Built-in optimizations, API routes eliminate separate backend
- **Cost**: Free tier covers development and small-scale deployment

**Key Benefits:**
- App Router for modern React patterns
- Built-in API routes reduce architecture complexity
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading

### Alternatives considered
- **Create React App**: Rejected due to need for separate backend setup and limited optimization features
- **Vite + React**: Rejected for consistency with Next.js ecosystem and deployment simplicity

## Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.0

##### Why we picked it
- **Familiarity level**: Utility-first approach reduces custom CSS complexity
- **Community + docs**: Excellent documentation, widely adopted, consistent updates
- **Performance / scalability**: Purged CSS, small bundle sizes, responsive design utilities
- **Cost**: Free and open source

**Key Benefits:**
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Consistent design system through utility classes
- Responsive design utilities built-in
- No CSS naming conflicts

### Alternatives considered
- **Styled Components**: Rejected due to runtime overhead and TypeScript complexity
- **CSS Modules**: Rejected for slower development velocity compared to utilities

## Stock Data: Alpha Vantage API

##### Why we picked it
- **Familiarity level**: Clear documentation, straightforward REST API
- **Community + docs**: Well-documented API with TypeScript examples
- **Performance / scalability**: Reliable uptime, reasonable rate limits for development
- **Cost**: Free tier provides 5 API requests per minute, 500 requests per day

**Key Benefits:**
- Real-time and historical stock data
- Clean JSON responses easy to type with TypeScript
- No unofficial API risks
- Comprehensive company information included

### Alternatives considered
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Rejected due to unofficial status and potential reliability issues
- **IEX Cloud**: Rejected due to more complex pricing structure for basic features

---

## Runtime: Node.js

##### Why we picked it
- **Familiarity level**: JavaScript everywhere, single language stack
- **Community + docs**: Mature ecosystem, extensive package availability
- **Performance / scalability**: Sufficient for portfolio project scope, V8 engine performance
- **Cost**: Free runtime, included with hosting solutions

**Key Benefits:**
- Consistent development experience across frontend and backend
- Rich npm ecosystem for API integrations
- Native JSON handling
- Excellent TypeScript support

### Alternatives considered
- **Python + Flask**: Rejected to maintain JavaScript consistency
- **Go**: Rejected due to additional language complexity for project scope

## Development Tools

| Tool      | Choice        | Why it fits                    |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Linting   | ESLint        | TypeScript integration, Next.js rules |
| Formatting| Prettier      | Consistent code style, automatic formatting |
| Validation| Built-in      | TypeScript native, no additional runtime overhead |

##### ESLint + Prettier
- **Why we picked it**: Industry standard, excellent TypeScript support, automated code quality
- **Community + docs**: Extensive rule sets, Next.js specific configurations available
- **Performance**: Build-time validation, no runtime impact
- **Cost**: Free and open source

### Alternatives considered
- **TSLint**: Rejected as deprecated in favor of ESLint TypeScript support
- **Biome**: Rejected for ESLint's more mature TypeScript ecosystem

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Planned: Vercel
- **Why choosing it**: Optimized for Next.js, zero-config deployment, excellent performance
- **Community + docs**: First-party Next.js integration, comprehensive documentation
- **Performance**: Global CDN, automatic optimizations, serverless functions
- **Cost**: Free tier sufficient for portfolio projects

### Alternatives being considered
- **Netlify**: Similar features but less Next.js specific optimization
- **Railway**: Good for full-stack apps but unnecessary complexity for this project
