# ADR-0002: Week 1 Infrastructure Setup

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

After implementing the portfolio dashboard, Week 1 infrastructure items (Issues #7-12) needed completion to establish production-ready development practices. The project required environment management, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline, and containerization before advancing to Week 2 features.

## Decision

Implemented comprehensive infrastructure setup covering:

### Environment Management
- **Secure API Key Storage**: Created `utils/env.ts` with validation and sanitization
- **Environment Templates**: `.env.example` and `.env.local.example` with Alpha Vantage configuration
- **Validation Script**: `npm run validate-env` for environment verification

### Testing Infrastructure  
- **Jest Framework**: Full TypeScript support with React Testing Library
- **Test Configuration**: `jest.config.js` with Next.js integration and module mapping
- **Coverage Reporting**: Configured for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Sample Tests**: Environment utilities and Alpha Vantage functions

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive testing
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Node.js 18.x and 20.x matrix
- **Security Auditing**: Integrated `audit-ci` for vulnerability scanning
- **PR Templates**: Standardized pull request process

### Containerization
- **Production Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with Node 20 Alpine
- **Development Dockerfile**: Hot reloading with volume mounting
- **Docker Compose**: Both production and development configurations
- **Next.js Optimization**: Standalone output for optimized container size

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive infrastructure for professional development
- **Code Quality**: Automated testing and linting in CI pipeline
- **Security**: Environment validation and vulnerability scanning
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent environments via Docker
- **Scalability**: Foundation supports team collaboration and deployment

### Technical Implementation
- **All Tests Pass**: 14 unit tests covering critical functionality
- **TypeScript Clean**: Strict mode compilation without errors
- **CI Integration**: Automated quality checks on every PR
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README updates with setup instructions

### Next Steps Enabled
- **Week 2 Development**: Ready for AI explanation API implementation
- **Team Onboarding**: Docker ensures consistent development environments
- **Deployment**: Infrastructure supports Vercel and container deployment

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Minimal Infrastructure**: Skip testing and CI for rapid development
   - Rejected: Technical debt and quality issues at scale

2. **Docker-Only Development**: Force all development through containers
   - Rejected: Slower development experience for local iteration

3. **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based development environment
   - Rejected: Cost and complexity for current team size

## Implementation Notes

- **Environment Security**: API keys validated and sanitized in error messages
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on utility functions and critical business logic
- **CI Efficiency**: Cached dependencies and parallel job execution
- **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds minimize production image size
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup instructions for all environments

## Compliance with Standards

- **CLAUDE.md Workflow**: Followed Research → Plan → Implement sequence
- **ADR Format**: Proper documentation of architectural decisions
- **Code Quality**: 100% clean code with passing tests and linters
- **Git Workflow**: Ready for feature branch development with clear commit history
