# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the StockAI project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle. Each ADR documents:

- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The impact of the decision

## Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

**Status**: Accepted/Superseded/Deprecated
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: Team member(s)

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?
```

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially:
- `0001-use-nextjs-for-frontend.md`
- `0002-alpha-vantage-for-stock-data.md`
- `0003-typescript-strict-mode.md`
