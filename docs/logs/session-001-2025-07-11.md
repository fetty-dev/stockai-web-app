# Dev Log - Session 001 (2025-07-11)

## 🎯 Session Overview
- **Focus**: Week 1 Issues 1-2 Completion + UI/UX Planning Setup
- **Branch**: `feature/week1-stock-data-integration`
- **Key Achievement**: Fully functional stock API with Alpha Vantage integration

## ✅ Completed GitHub Issues (1-6 CLOSED)

### **Issues #1-3: Foundation Setup (feature/week1-foundation branch)**
- ✅ **Issue #1**: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- ✅ **Issue #2**: Configure development tools and linting  
- ✅ **Issue #3**: Set up Tailwind CSS and UI foundation
- **Deliverables**: Next.js 14, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint/Prettier, landing page

### **Issues #4-6: API Integration (feature/week1-stock-data-integration branch)**
- ✅ **Issue #4**: Create TypeScript interfaces for stock data
- ✅ **Issue #5**: Build Yahoo Finance API integration (implemented as Alpha Vantage)
- ✅ **Issue #6**: Create stock lookup API route
- **Deliverables**: Working `/api/stock` endpoint, Alpha Vantage integration, TypeScript types, test page

### **Code Quality & Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed unused Yahoo Finance code
- ✅ Consolidated types in central types file
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified
- ✅ Git workflow with proper PR creation and merging

## 🧠 Technical Decisions Made

### **API Provider Selection**
- **Problem**: Yahoo Finance returning 401 errors
- **Solution**: Migrated to Alpha Vantage (500 requests/day free tier)
- **Result**: Reliable real-time stock data integration

### **TypeScript Architecture**
- **Strategy**: Strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- **Implementation**: Central types file with proper exports
- **Result**: 100% type safety throughout application

### **Git Workflow**
- **Pattern**: Feature branches for logical issue groups with PR workflow
- **Branch 1**: `feature/week1-foundation` → Issues #1-3 → Merged PR
- **Branch 2**: `feature/week1-stock-data-integration` → Issues #4-6 → Merged PR
- **Current**: On `main` branch, ready for next feature branch

## 🚨 Critical Gap Identified

### **UI/UX Missing**
- **Problem**: Strong backend but no functional frontend UI
- **Current State**: Default Next.js landing page with API working
- **User Created**: `TODO.md` with specific UI/UX gaps identified
- **Need**: Wireframes, page layout, search interface design

## 📊 GitHub Issues Status

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

### **Immediate Focus: UI/UX (from TODO.md)**
1. Create wireframes or page mockups for main dashboard
2. Design overall dashboard layout structure  
3. Design search interface (stock input form)
4. Plan navigation structure and header
5. Define page flow between components (search → results)

### **Implementation Approach**
- Start with simple wireframe/mockup (5-10 minutes)
- Build core UI components using existing TypeScript specs
- Connect UI to working `/api/stock` endpoint
- Focus on functional MVP before polish

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### **Working Configuration**
- **Node.js**: Latest with npm
- **Next.js**: 15.3.5
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3 (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS**: 4.0.0
- **API**: Alpha Vantage (key configured in `.env`)

### **Development Commands**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run type-check   # Verify TypeScript
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint check
```

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/stock?symbol=AAPL` - Working stock data retrieval
- `/test-api` - API testing interface

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

### **Development Partnership (CLAUDE.md)**
- Following Research → Plan → Implement workflow
- Using TodoWrite for task tracking
- Git workflow with beginner-friendly commands
- Reality checkpoints at feature completion

### **User Preferences**
- Solo development with immediate PR merging
- Prefers latest dependency versions
- Values clean code and removing unused files
- Wants professional GitHub workflow visible

## 📝 Session End State

### **Current Branch**: `main` (ready for new feature branch)
### **Working Features**: 
- Landing page at `localhost:3000`
- API at `localhost:3000/api/stock?symbol=AAPL`
- Test interface at `localhost:3000/test-api`

### **Ready for Next Session**:
- TODO.md defines clear UI/UX priorities
- Backend fully functional and tested
- Clean codebase with proper TypeScript types
- Professional Git workflow established

**💡 Context for Next Claude Session**: User has strong backend foundation with working stock API. Main gap is UI/UX design and component implementation. Focus on TODO.md priorities and build functional frontend to complete Week 1 deliverables.
